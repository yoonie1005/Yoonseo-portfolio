                    <h1>Iteration</h1>
                    <p>It was hard to find one specific topic related to social enterpise.I usually think of a service only with profit, however, since it is non-profit, I firstly thought of what service can contribute to society. So, I chose the topic related to my major, 'film' where I studied how Asians and immigrants in the US were described on the film. I literally knew that the racism happens because of superiority, tropes and stereotypes; which helped to do secondary research based on my background. Thus, I think I did well for listing all the questions for the topic.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While learning how to create sprint, it was interesting to see it. It was not that hard to create sprint with Figma. I would like to use Kanban, Jira, Asana, Monday and Float to create sprint as Melody recommended in further future. I think I did well with listing up what I have to do according to school schedule. However, I worried a bit to make it if nobody tells me what I should do with schedule at work.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Another thing that I felt difficult was to find users for the interview. It is because I am thinking about targeting MPA (Maori, Pacific Islanders and Asians). </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The reason why I felt hard about social enterprise topic was because I didn't find  that much references related to the main topic. Also, Melody and Simon didn't recommend to choose the topic that we can't solve on our own such as 'Climate Change'. Thus, I realized that it would be useful to search references sites in further future.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>Additionally, it was a bit hard to define the problem with 'Racism' because it would be sensitive to ask questions to users. I sent an email to Maori museum to ask if I can meet Maori or Pacific Islanders, but I think it would be hard to find them in person. Thus, I am thinking about more focusing on Asian.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Lastly, I felt hard to make assumption mapping as well. I didn't know what each criteria exactly means (important/ unimportant, known/unknown).</p> 
                    <br>
                    <h2>Interesting lesson</h2>
                    <p>For joint lecture, I learned how to create campaign. 
                        <li>Choose theme card - pet adoption</li>
                        <li>Theme associations - dog, family member</li>
                        <li>Theme implications - helping, providing home</li>
                        <li>Prompt- shadows</li>
                        <li>Prompt associations - darkness, sunset</li>
                        <li>*** New metaphor that links these 2 concepts together- Adopt a pet bring ligght into your life</li>
                        <br>
                        <p>We are all doing social enterprise assignments; so William taught us how to make campaign sentence.</p>
