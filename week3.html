                    <h1>Reflection</h1>
                    <p>When I started this project, my initial goal was to create a name-blind job application process by hiding names on CVs and cover letters. I believed that removing identifying information could help reduce unconscious bias during the hiring process. However, after discussing with Melody and exploring the job search platform myself, I realized that this approach would not be feasible. Most platforms require users to upload their CVs and cover letters in PDF format, which are documents applicants create themselves. Because of this, it's almost impossible to enforce anonymity—applicants would still have control over what information they include.</p>

                    <br>
                    
                    <p>This limitation led me to rethink my approach. Instead of trying to hide names in the traditional application format, I began to explore alternative ways to support fair and unbiased hiring. I came up with a marketing idea that brings both employers and job seekers together in a shared workshop environment. Like a career fair, this “blind workshop” would allow participants to interact and demonstrate their skills without revealing personal information at the start. I believe this concept could promote more equitable hiring practices and help shift the focus from identity to ability.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Through this process, I’ve learned that while certain goals may seem simple in theory, the reality of implementation can reveal unexpected challenges. But rather than giving up on the goal of fairness, I’ve adapted the idea into a more practical solution—something that still aligns with the original intention, while working within real-world constraints. I plan to design a marketing landing page to present this idea more clearly and share it with others who are also interested in inclusive hiring practices.</p>
