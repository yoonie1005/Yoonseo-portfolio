                    <h1>Reflection</h1>
                    <p>Through this project, I realized how important it is to take time for discovery instead of trying to solve the problem too quickly. I tend to rush into finding solutions, but this approach often overlooks the process of deeply understanding the problem space. Especially when defining a problem, I encountered several challenges.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>One of the biggest difficulties was identifying problems from a user-centered perspective. I learned that it’s essential to locate the specific point where users are struggling—what exactly isn’t being solved for them. However, I often ended up thinking about issues that were too broad. Even within these wide topics, I failed to narrow down to the user’s exact difficulties. For example, in one of my early ideas, I focused on plastic pollution caused by cigarette butts. But this was a situation-based issue, not a user-focused one. Similarly, when thinking about media for young audiences, I concentrated more on the media itself than on the user’s interaction or needs. These experiences made me ask myself, “How can I focus more on users’ problems within a broad topic?”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When I worked on a landing page project for an AI B2B company, I faced a similar issue. The company aimed to attract 200 new business clients, but many of these potential clients didn’t even know how to find or access the company’s website. Compared to other companies, our pricing was much more affordable, yet that wasn’t being reflected in our traffic or inquiries. At the time, I wasn’t sure what the core problem was. I eventually realized that what I really needed was market research before even defining the problem statement. This helped me understand that the initial phase—problem identification—must begin with research and data, not assumptions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Another area where I struggled was in the process of converging ideas after collecting insights. I found it relatively easy to gather insights, but narrowing them down into a focused direction was much more difficult.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also faced challenges when trying to identify user problems through their behavior. I didn’t always know what kind of questions to ask or which moments in the user journey to focus on. For instance, when someone is looking for a job, what are they really paying attention to—whether the role is part-time or full-time? What do they bring with them as expectations? Rather than asking directly, “Have you experienced discrimination while job hunting?” it would be better to ask what path they took to get there, and where they encountered difficulties in that journey. Understanding the behavior behind their decisions provides more valuable insights.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also struggled with organizing the research process logically. When addressing a topic like racism, I needed to identify who is most affected and in what ways. From there, I should have explored whether platforms already exist to help those specific users and what kinds of services are offered. This would allow me to clearly define both the main and secondary target users, and eventually organize a more complete stakeholder map. However, I was often confused about the correct order to do these things, which delayed my progress.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Lastly, receiving and interpreting feedback was another challenge. Because the course was in English, I found it hard to catch exactly which parts of my work were being pointed out. I had to revisit lessons multiple times just to understand the feedback. I’m still learning which words and phrases are most effective to use in critiques and how to apply feedback to improve my work.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Overall, this project helped me recognize my tendencies and gaps in problem definition, research, and focusing on users. Going forward, I want to improve by slowing down in the early stages, asking better questions, and sharpening my understanding of the user’s journey.</p>
